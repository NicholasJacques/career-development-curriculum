| Timing | Facilitator Talking Points | Participant Actions |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------|
| 3 minutes | Introduce the session with the objectives on Slide 4. Then, on the next slide, discuss why we're talking about feedback. Read the reasons off of the the slide, but you can also solicit 1-2 additional reasons from students if they would like to contribute | Whole Group Discussion |
| 6 minutes | Read the directions on Slide 7 about the Personal Reflection that students will write. As they start writing, circulate the room to ensure that everyone is on task |  Students should write in their notebooks if they have them; if not, they can create a gist |
| 5 minutes | Direct students to do a Turn and Talk to discuss their reflections on feedback with a partner. If needed, there can be groups of 3. Circulate the room while students discuss. | Paired discussion |
| 2 minutes | On Slide 8, review the 3 triggers to feedback by soliciting answers for what each trigger means and when people might experience them by cold-calling on students. For your reference: truth triggers occur when you feel that the feedback is unhelpful or somehow untrue; relationship triggers are related to the particular person giving the feedback and what your relationship is with them; identity triggers are about us and how the feedback might make us feel unsure about ourselves | Students provide answers when called on |
| 5 minutes | (Slides 9-12) Talk through the 3 different kinds of feedback: **Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation. Appreciation** is giving thanks to your partner and encouraging your partner to keep doing what they're doing well. For this to be effective, the appreciation needs to be specific, authentic, and delivered in a form that works for you -- you want to be true to yourself when delivering this feedback. **Coaching** is discussing a better way to do something in order to help your partner grow. Coaching can be related to improving your skills or fixing a perceived imbalance in a relationship. To be effective, coaching is about listening to what your partner would really benefit from and asking questions of them. Coaching also needs to be very specific. **Evaluation** is telling your partner where they stand compared to a standard or compared to others. Evaluation aligns expectations and clarifies consequences. To be effective, you need to have clear standards and expectations to evaluate against. Note to students: During this feedback cycle, you'll be giving appreciation and coaching to your partners but not evaluation; since this is your first time working with them, you don't have any comparisons to provide. | Students listen and take notes as needed |


| 3 minutes | Introduce active listening by saying: *An important skill from the body stage of the feedback conversation is **listening.** What does it mean to actively listen? What can make it difficult to really listen to someone?* Ask for people to raise their hands: *how many of you have had a conversation where you were thinking about what you would say in response to the other person while they were talking instead of fully listening to them?* Most likely, many students will raise their hands. *That's why working on active listening skills is so important.* Post link to [reading](https://www.fastcompany.com/3036026/5-ways-to-improve-your-listening-skills) in their slack channels if they don't have access to the markdown. |  Students reading silently for 3 minutes |
| 15 mins | Introduce conversation practice. Have the students first write in their journals what key points they need to discuss and how they will do that. Also, as posted on the slide, have them think about how to use their listening skills during the conversation. Then have students move into their project groups to have their feedback discussion. Reflections should be about 5 minutes and conversations should be about 10 minutes | Students write in their journals and then sit with project groups to deliver feedback to each other. |
| 5 mins | Close with the last slide discussing next steps and have students reflect on this practice in their journals with the posted reflection questions | Students write in journals silently |
